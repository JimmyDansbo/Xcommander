Commander X16 File Manager

The 8-bit guy a.k.a David Murray requested a Norton Commander style file manager for the Commander X16.
As I have already created a mockup of the Norton-/Midnight Commander for the [VTUI library](https://github.com/jimmydansbo/vtuilib/), I thought that this was a task I could start.

The aim of the project is to create a file manager for the Commander X16 that looks and feels like Norton Commander and makes it easier to browse through the directory structure on an SD card and the files on an IEC device like and old Commodore Floppy drive.
